<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The Growth team aims to identify which product categories drive sustainable profits, crucial for long-term success. The challenge is to understand profitability across different product categories, subcategories, and customer segments to inform strategic business decisions.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The main objectives of this analysis are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To identify the most profitable product categories and subcategories.</li>
    <li>To determine which products and customer segments are contributing to or hindering profitability.</li>
    <li>To provide actionable insights for optimizing business growth, revenue, and operational efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data and Tools</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> Product sales, customer details, and order history.</li>
    <li><strong>SQL:</strong> For data extraction and initial analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>PowerPoint:</strong> For presenting the insights effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Insights</h2>
<h3>Product Category Analysis</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Technology</strong> is identified as the most profitable category, whereas <strong>Furniture</strong> is the least profitable.</li>
    <li>Certain subcategories, such as <strong>Rubber Bands</strong> and <strong>Bookcases</strong>, are unprofitable and may require divestment or restructuring.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Subcategory & Item Analysis</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Profitable subcategories are predominantly within the <strong>Technology</strong> category, like <strong>Telephones and Communication</strong> and <strong>Office Machines</strong>.</li>
    <li>At the product level, items such as <strong>Prod_17</strong>, <strong>Prod_4</strong>, and <strong>Prod_3</strong> are top performers. However, <strong>Prod_16</strong>, <strong>Prod_10</strong>, and <strong>Prod_11</strong> are associated with losses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Customer Segmentation Analysis</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The analysis reveals that a small group of customers (around 20%) generates the majority of revenue (80%), in line with the 80/20 rule. These high-value customers are critical for maintaining business success.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geographic Insights</h3>
<ul>
    <li>By analyzing average order values across different cities and states, key areas for targeted marketing and inventory management are identified.</li>
